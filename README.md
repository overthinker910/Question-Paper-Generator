# Question-Paper-Generator


A system that generates a question paper according to the difficulty level that the question paper designer wants. 
We are designing an adaptive question bank management system that is picking questions from database and generate paper according to parameters provided by the question paper designer. 
To implement this, there will be a database of questions which will be sorted based on difficulty and marks. Therefore, our system is a flexible and intelligent question paper generator. 
While this application is still a work in progress, it is believed that the success of this project will provide a great aid for the organization in effective question modeling and its assessment. 
This system can be used in universities for generating and distributing question papers. The system can also be implemented in different organizations that conduct regular exams.
